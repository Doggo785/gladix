        // therefore DEFAULTS TO TRUE, and everything in the app's data dir is eligible for cloud
        // backup and device-to-device transfer, restorable onto a different device.
        // ⚠️ RECORDED BECAUSE IT WAS RAISED AS A DEFECT AND IS NOT ONE - so that the next
        // person to notice it does not re-raise it, and so that anyone who DOES need to change it can
        // see what was weighed rather than starting over. WHY IT IS ACCEPTED:
        //   ⚠️ IT IS INHERITED, NOT INTRODUCED HERE. Upstream Echo's AndroidManifest declares
        //     none of the three either, so this fork did not create the exposure and changing it is a
        //     divergence, not a repair.
        //   ⚠️ IT IS THE PLATFORM WORKING AS DESIGNED, AND ARGUABLY WHAT USERS WANT. Auto
        //     Backup is opt-OUT; backups have been end-to-end encrypted with a key derived from the
        //     device lock screen since Android 9; and they restore only to the SAME Google account.
        //     The intended behaviour is exactly what happens - set up a new phone and your apps come
        //     back with their state, logins included. Most apps do not opt out. Password managers and
        //     banking apps do, and that is the company this would be choosing to keep.
        // WHAT IS ELIGIBLE, from a survey of the getSharedPreferences call sites and the Room
        // builders - listed so a reopening starts from facts rather than a re-survey:
        //   ExtensionDatabase's UserEntity.data - a serialised User whose `extras` carry the login
        //     secret. For Deezer that is the ARL cookie (DeezerExtension's manual login form declares
        //     key = "arl" and reads it back out of user.extras). A Room db in databases/ is
        //     backup-eligible on the same default. THIS IS THE ITEM THE DECISION ACTUALLY TURNS ON.
        //   Per-extension settings - one SharedPreferences file per extension, named `<TYPE>-<id>`
        //     (ExtensionUtils.extensionPrefId), holding whatever that extension's SettingsProvider
        //     chooses to store. WE DO NOT CONTROL THAT VOCABULARY, which is the part most likely to
        //     change underneath this decision.
        //   Device-shaped state - fx_<name> / GLOBAL_FX audio-effect settings, which describe the
        //     hardware they were tuned on; gladix_health_monitor; history_sort; the main
        //     SETTINGS_NAME file (where the version-code keys read below also live).
        // ⚠⚠ WHEN TO REOPEN THIS DELIBERATELY: if an extension ever stores something that
        // genuinely must not cross devices - a device-bound token, a per-install key, anything whose
        // validity is tied to THIS phone rather than to the account. That is a change in the third
        // bullet's vocabulary, and nothing warns us when it happens. The fix would then be
        // `dataExtractionRules` excluding the specific file, NOT allowBackup=false, which would throw
        // away the restore behaviour users expect in order to protect one key.
        // ⚠️ AND IF YOU GO TO CHECK WHAT IS ELIGIBLE: `adb backup` RETURNS 0 BYTES ON AT LEAST
        // ONE DEVICE HERE AND THAT PROVES NOTHING. It exercises the legacy local-transport path, which
        // modern Android has largely retired; cloud backup and D2D transfer do not go through it. An
        // empty adb backup is evidence THAT ROUTE CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTION, not evidence that
        // nothing is backed up. Find another method before concluding anything.
        // The version-code keys read below are defended against a restore by their own three-term
        // gate (see AppUpdater.recordSelfUpdateOnLaunch) - that gate exists because a restored value
        // would be WRONG, not because backup itself is.

        // ⚠⚠ LOOKS LIKE THE BUILD-974 CRASH SHAPE AND IS NOT. EXAMINED TWICE; LEAVE IT.
        // A bare CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO) has no CoroutineExceptionHandler, so a throw inside it
        // reaches the DEFAULT UNCAUGHT HANDLER and kills the process — which is how a Spotify 500 became a
        // FATAL on build 974. Taking `extensionLoader` as an argument makes this look like the same gap,
        // and a reader scanning for bare scopes WILL stop here. It was flagged that way on 2026-09-10 and
        // the flag was wrong.
        // WHY IT IS SAFE: configureAppShortcuts IMMEDIATELY HANDS OFF (AppShortcuts:105-108). Its whole body
        // is `val scope = loader.scope; val musicExt = loader.music; scope.launch { … }` — two property

        // throw from extension code ever runs on THIS scope; the collectLatest that touches extensions runs
        // on the guarded one.
        // ⚠️ WHAT WOULD BREAK IT: adding work to this launch body, or changing configureAppShortcuts to do
        // anything before its hand-off. Then this scope needs the handler — use app.scope (Koin-provided,
        // see DI.kt) rather than adding a second bare one. See the called-vs-launched note at
