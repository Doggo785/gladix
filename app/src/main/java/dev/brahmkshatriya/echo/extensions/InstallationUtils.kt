        // checked, so it is written out here: VERIFY THE NUMBER, DO NOT RECALL IT.
        // ⚠️ AND THE WRONG ADVICE WAS THE EXPENSIVE KIND. The report carried
        // app_update_stage=ready, i.e. an APP SELF-UPDATE (see the corrected note above and
        // CrashKeys.onAppUpdateStage) - so "uninstall the existing version first" was telling a user
        // to DESTROY THEIR OWN APP DATA to work around a Play-Protect-style block that uninstalling
        // would not have lifted. It reaches the screen, not just Crashlytics: ExtensionsViewModel's
        // `awaitInstallation(appApk).getOrThrow()` sits in a runCatching whose getOrElse emits to
        // app.throwFlow, i.e. a snackbar.
        // ⚠️ NONE OF THIS WAS A REGRESSION ON THE EXTRA_RETURN_RESULT FIX - THAT FIX HELD. The
        // version-code comparison above ran and correctly declined to return early (installed 1100
        // was NOT >= the downloaded build), so the failure was REAL and only its EXPLANATION was
        // wrong. Behaviour was never the defect here; do not go looking for one.
        //
        // ⚠️ `isSelf` IS DERIVED, NOT PASSED, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE - it keeps the
        // caller-agnostic principle above rather than breaking it. installApp has ONE call site
        // (ExtensionsViewModel's installFileFlow collector) serving BOTH the app self-updater and
        // ImportType.App extensions, and the File it receives carries no hint of which. Comparing the
        // archive's own packageName to ours answers it from the artifact itself, so no flag can be
        // forgotten at a future second call site. It needs no null check: `installed != null` already
        // implies `apk != null`, because installed is derived from apk.packageName.
        // ⚠️ THE APP/EXTENSION SPLIT MATTERS ONLY ON THE -7 BRANCH, and it matters a lot there:
        // "uninstall it first" is a shrug for an extension and DATA LOSS for the app. Say the cost.
        // ⚠️ THE -22 TEXT NAMES TWO PLACES TO LOOK AND COMMITS TO NEITHER. The result code says
        // a verifier refused; it does NOT say WHICH, and on an OEM build there may be two (Play
        // Protect plus the vendor's own installer scan). Guessing one would send half the users who
        // hit this to a setting that is not the one blocking them, so the message says both and says
        // that it does not know. Do not "tighten" it to a single culprit without evidence that the
        // code can distinguish them - it cannot.
