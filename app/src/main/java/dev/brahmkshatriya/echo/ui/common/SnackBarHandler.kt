    // Pending snackbars, drained one at a time: create() only emits when nothing is showing, and remove()
    // emits the next on dismissal. Deliberately on the Koin SINGLETON so queued messages survive activity
    // recreation - do not move it to the Activity or clear it on recreate.
    private val messages = mutableListOf<Queued>()

    // ⚠⚠ THE TIMESTAMP LIVES ON THE QUEUE ENTRY, NEVER ON Message. Message is in :common, i.e.
    // the extension ABI - adding a field there carries the version-skew hazard documented at
    // SearchFeedClient (an extension built against one shape, running against another). A private wrapper
    // costs nothing and keeps the ABI untouched.
    private data class Queued(val at: Long, val message: Message)

    // ⚠⚠ ACCUMULATE UNGATED, RENDER GATED. THIS IS THE WHOLE FIX, AND THE SPLIT IS THE POINT.
    //
    // ⚠⚠ THE RULE, WHICH IS THE DURABLE PART: UNGATE A COLLECTOR THAT UPDATES STATE, NEVER ONE
    // THAT PRESENTS A TRANSIENT VIEW.
    // PlayerFragment's queueFlow collector was correctly made ungated - it calls submit(), which updates a
    // data structure, is idempotent, and renders correctly whenever the view next becomes visible. So the
    // obvious next step is "ungate setupSnackBar's observe() too". THAT IS WRONG AND STRICTLY WORSE THAN
    // TODAY, and someone will propose it again, so here is the mechanism:
    //   an ungated collector runs while STOPPED (lifecycleScope is cancelled only at DESTROYED);
    //   Snackbar.show() would add the view to a hierarchy nobody is looking at;
    //   its LENGTH_LONG timeout elapses invisibly;
    //   onDismissed fires with event != DISMISS_EVENT_MANUAL;
    //   which calls remove(message, dismissed = true) and DELETES IT FROM THIS QUEUE.
    // The message is silently CONSUMED without ever being seen. Today it at least stays queued. Ungating
    // converts a delivery failure into a DESTRUCTIVE one.
    // A snackbar is an event WITH A DURATION; running it while invisible spends the duration and destroys
    // the event. A state update has no duration and cannot be spent.
    //
    // So the accumulate step - which is pure state work - is ungated here on app.scope, and the RENDER step
    // stays lifecycle-gated in setupSnackBar. That also means every emitter is captured with ZERO call-site
    // changes: there are 32 direct app.messageFlow.emit callers across the app (Download, Login, AppUpdater,
    // PlayerViewModel, PlayerCallback, SaveToPlaylist, MediaDetails and more), and only a handful ever
    // reached create(). Routing them by hand would have been the bulk of the work and a standing trap for
    // every emitter added later.
    //
    // ⚠️ SYNCHRONIZED, WHICH THE ORIGINAL DID NOT NEED. create()/remove() were both called from
    // lifecycleScope, i.e. Main only. This collector runs on app.scope (IO), so `messages` is now genuinely
    // touched from two threads.
    // ⚠️ maxQueuedMessages and messageTtlMs are declared BELOW this block and read by enqueue().
    // Safe because launch() only SCHEDULES the collector - the lambda body runs after construction
    // completes, by which point every property is initialized. It would NOT be safe if this were ever
    // changed to collect synchronously here.

    // Dedupe by VALUE, not by Message identity. `messages.contains(message)` compared whole Messages, and
    // Message.action holds a LAMBDA - lambdas have no structural equality, so two identical actionable
    // messages never compared equal and the dedupe silently did nothing for every one of them, including
    // every LoginRequired snackbar. Comparing the text plus the action's NAME restores it: the name is what
    // the user reads on the button, so two entries sharing both are the same notification as far as anyone
    // can tell, even though their handlers are distinct objects.
    private fun Message.dedupeKey() = message to action?.name

    // The queue was uncapped. That was survivable only because throwFlow was a zero-buffer SharedFlow whose
    // back-pressure meant a burst mostly never reached create() at all - the containment the Aug 2026 note
    // relied on. Buffering throwFlow/messageFlow (App.kt) removes exactly that, so every emission in a burst
    // now arrives here and, without the fix above, every actionable one appended. Hence a hard cap.
    // 16 is past the point of usefulness rather than a guess at a limit: snackbars are LENGTH_LONG, so a
    // full queue is already ~a minute of consecutive snackbars, and nobody reads the tail. Crashlytics keeps
    // the complete record either way - this list is a notification queue, not a log.
    // Drop OLDEST: a queue this deep is stale, and the newest message describes the current state.
    private val maxQueuedMessages = 16

    // ⚠⚠ 60s, AND IT DOES TWO JOBS - THE SECOND ONE IS NOT OBVIOUS AND IS EASY TO BREAK.
    // JOB 1, STALENESS: a message queued while the Activity was stopped and shown on the next launch can be
    // worse than dropping it - "Playing X" an hour later is noise. The driver for the VALUE is the
    // motivating case, returning from the system "install unknown apps" screen (AppUpdater), which is
    // seconds to tens of seconds. 60s covers a realistic detour and discards anything from a previous
    // session. (restoreCache's 90s answers a DIFFERENT question - whether a cached computation is still
    // valid - so it is not a precedent for this number, only for having one.)
    // ⚠️ JOB 2, ROUTING: because the accumulator above is indiscriminate, THIS TTL IS NOW THE
    // ENTIRE MECHANISM by which background-originated messages fail to surface on a later phone launch.
    // Three are AA- or playback-originated and can fire with no Activity at all:
    //     AndroidAutoCallback:1027   some_tracks_couldnt_be_restored
    //     PlayerEventListener:1298   server_error_skipping
    //     PlayerEventListener:1569   removed_extension_playback_stopped
    // "List is empty" surfacing on a phone launch for something that happened in the car is worse than
    // dropping it, and only the TTL prevents that. SO CHANGING THIS VALUE SILENTLY CHANGES ROUTING
    // BEHAVIOUR, not just freshness. If 60s proves too generous, those three are the opt-out candidates -
    // but note an exclusion mechanism would need a marker ON Message, which is ABI-frozen, so the honest
    // alternatives are a shorter TTL or a second flow, not a flag.
    private val messageTtlMs = 60_000L

    // ⚠⚠ [FIXED] THIS USED TO WEDGE, AND THE WEDGE - NOT THE LOST MESSAGE - IS THE STRONGEST
    // REASON THIS WORK EXISTS. It read:
    //     if (messages.isEmpty()) messageFlow.emit(message)
    //     if (messages.none { ... }) { messages.add(message); ... }
    // so it emitted ONLY when the queue was empty. If that one emission was lost - e.g. the Activity was
    // stopped, since messageFlow is replay = 0 with a single lifecycle-gated subscriber - the message was
    // still ADDED, and from then on the queue was non-empty, so NOTHING EMITTED AGAIN. The only other
    // emitter is remove(), which needs a snackbar to be dismissed, which needs one to have been shown.
    // Net: the queue could hold up to 16 undelivered messages INDEFINITELY with no trigger to show them.
    // That is a wedge, not a dropped message, and it is independent of the lifecycle gate.
    // Now: create() only emits. The accumulator above queues every emission, and setupSnackBar renders the
    // head on STARTED, so a lost emission is recovered on the next visible frame rather than stranding the
    // queue behind it.
